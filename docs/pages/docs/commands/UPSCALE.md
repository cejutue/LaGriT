# UPSCALE

-------


The **upscale** command is used to interpolate attribute values from nodes of a fine source mesh to node attributes of a coarse sink mesh.
This is most often used to assign geostatistical property values from an application to the computational mesh for modeling.

This command finds dense source nodes that are within the Voronoi cell of every node in the coarser sink mesh. The voronoi volume around each sink node is the bucket that captures all node values to compute. Nodes on the voronoi boundaries
 are assigned to two or more sink nodes. Then the attributes of all the source nodes within a source node's cell are upscaled into a single
 value based on the chosen method. 

 A kdtree node search is used to find the source mesh nodes located in
 each of the Voronoi sink point volumes. It is possible for source
 nodes to occur on the boundary of multiple Voronoi volumes. By
 default, all nodes found in each Voronoi volume are used to upscale to
 the enclosed sink node. In this case, source nodes on multiple Voronoi
 boundaries will be included in upscale calculations more than once.
 
 It is important that the source points be denser than the sink mesh node spacing. If no source points are found within a voronoi volume, the source point is given a value of 0.
 
 Geostat data sometimes generate very small values close to zero that are not appropriate for modeling. It is recommended that a mininum reasonable value be assigned. Be sure the range of source values are what is intended.
 
 For the averaging methods, make sure there are no source values of 0.

### Required:

`scale_method` is the choice of upscale calculation applied to each
  set of source nodes within each sink Voronoi cell where x(1) to x(n)
  are the values of source nodes 1 to n found for the sink point. 
The following are valid scale methods:

- **ariave**  For each sink point, calculate the arithmetic mean of n values from source attribute attsrc 
<br>
   sink_val = (x(1) + x(i)... + x(n)) / n example: for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 ariave = 2.5

   
- **geoave**  For each sink point, calculate the geometric average of n values found in attsrc
<br>
   sink\_val = ( x(1) * x(i)...  * x(n) ) * *(1/n) example: for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 geoave = 2.21336

   

-  **harave**  For each sink point, calculate the harmonic mean of n values from source attribute attsrc
<br>
  sink_val = n / ( 1/x(1) + 1/x(i)... + 1/x(n) ) example: for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 harave = 1.92


-  **min** or **max**  For each sink point, assign the min or max source attribute from n values found in attsrc
<br> sink_val = min(x(1),x(i),x(n)) example: for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 min = 1
<br> sink_val = max(x(1),x(i),x(n)) example: for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 max = 4

   
 -  **sum** For each sink point, calculate the sum of n values from source attribute attsrc
<br>
   sink_val = x(1) + x(i)... + x(n) example: for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 sum = 10

   

 
`cmosink`, `attsink` are the cmo name and attribute name to write sink values into. The scale method detirmines which calculation is
  applied to the source attribute value and written to the sink attribute. All integer attributes are converted to double for the
  calculations. The resulting values are then converted to the nearest integer if the sink attribute is integer.

 
`range` is the set of sink nodes to write scaled values to.  1,0,0 will select all sink nodes
 

`cmosrc`, `attsrc` are the cmo name and attribute name are the cmo and attribute to interpolate from. Points from the source grid will be
  located within the Voronoi volumes of sink nodes.

 
### Boundary options 

Optional parameters appearing after the source cmo attribute name are optional and may appear in any order.
 
`boundary_choice` provides a method of choice when source nodes are
  found on the boundary of multiple Voronoi volumes of sink nodes. By
  default, each set of souce nodes found within each volume are used
  to calculate an upscale value for the sink node. In this case if
  duplicate nodes occur on multiple cells, the sum number of nodes
  used in upscale calculations will exceed the sum total of nodes in
  the source mesh. If the number of source nodes used must equal the
  number of source mesh nodes, choose an **boundary_choice** to detirmine
  which sink volume an boundary node should be assigned to. The result
  is a one-to-one correspondence with each source point assigned to a
  single sink node id which is stored in source attribute pt_gtg.
  Source nodes that are found on shared Voronoi boundaries are flagged
  in source attribute dups_gtg.
 

- **single** selects the Voronoi volume of the first sink node encountered and does not use any after that.
This method can be used for situations that require the sum of nodes in each Voronoi space to equal the total of source points used. This one-to-one correspondence is written to the source cmo attribute pt_gtg. This attribute can be reused during multiple calls to the upscale command and will greatly reduce CPU time. 


- **divide** not implemented.


- **multiple** uses all source nodes found in each sink Voronoi volume.

 
### Added Attribute options

The following options are used with multiple calls to **upscale** with the
  same two grids. It keeps source attributes created during the search
  routines and uses these attributes to look up associated node
  numbers. 

The **upscale** command uses kdtree to create the source
  attribute pt_gtg that associates source nodes to sink node volumes.
  Note that this correlation is one-to-one and source nodes sharing
  multiple Voronoi volume boundary are tagged in a second source
  attribute called dups_gtg.
 

- **delatt** deletes any attributes created during the kdtree searches. By default these attributes are removed.


- **keepatt** keeps attributes pt_gtg and dups_gtg created during the kdtree searches. The source node attribute pt_gtg has the
   first found sink node id. The node attribute dups_gtg is flagged each time the source node occurs in a sink Voronoi cell, allowing
   the user to find source nodes on cell boundaries. Use of this attribute will greatly reduce CPU time.

   
- **set_id** creates and keeps the source attribute pt_gtg containing sink id numbers found from the sink mesh. This is the
   same attribute created and kept for the **keepatt** option except that if the attribute already exists, it is deleted and re-created
   with a new search. This is recomended if the pt_gtg attribute exists, but user is not sure the current sink mesh is the same as
   used to create the attribute.

## EXAMPLES
 
```
upscale / sum / cmo_sink icount /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival
upscale / sum / cmo_sink icount /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival/ single keepatt

upscale / min / cmo_sink imin /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival/ single keepatt set_id

upscale / max / cmo_sink imax /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival/ keepatt

upscale / ariave / cmo_sink ave_val /1,0,0/ cmo_src xval/
upscale / harave / cmo_sink har_val /1,0,0/ cmo_src xval/
upscale / geoave / cmo_sink geo_val /1,0,0/ cmo_src xval/
```



```
upscale / sum / cmo_sink icount /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival
```
In this example, search will find the sets of source nodes enclosed within each sink Voronoi cell.The ival attribute values are added for each set and written to the sink icount attribute. Because the attribte ival has all values set to 1, the icount attribute will contain the number of source nodes found in each Voronoi volume. The source node values will be counted regardless if they are on a Voronoi boundary and are in multiple Voronoi volumes. The result with duplicate boundary points will be a sum of points used greater than the total number of source mesh points. 


```
upscale / sum / cmo_sink icount /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival/ single keepatt 
```
This is the same as above  except that duplicate boundary points will be counted for the first found Voronoi volume and skipped thereafter. This one-to-one correspondance of source nodes to sink Voronoi volume will be stored in the source attributes pt_gtg with sink node numbers, and dups_gtg containing flags of the duplicate boundary points. These attributes will not be deleted. 
  

These images show the 10 numbered sink points and the 1221 source points. In this example all source points have an
imt1 value of 1. The sink points each have a value in icount equal to the number of nodes used for the associated Voronoi volume. The
red lines show the Voronoi cell boundaries for the 10 sink points.
