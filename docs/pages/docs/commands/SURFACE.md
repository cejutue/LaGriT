# SURFACE 

-----------------------


Defines a boundary, interface, or geometry for a selected mesh object. 

Surfaces are used to create geometry [**`REGION`**](REGION.md)  and material regions [**`MREGION`**](MREGION.md) for a mesh object.

Mesh interfaces will be assigned node constraint (**icr**) values corresponding to the surfaces on which nodes sit. 
The command [**`SETTETS`**](SETTETS.md) will generate parent/child node chains (**isn**) for nodes on **intrface** or **intrcons** surfaces.


The [inside/outside](#insideoutside) conventions for sheet surfaces are described below.


## SYNTAX 


<pre>
<b>surface</b>/isurname/ ibtype / istype / istype_parameters 

<b>surface</b>/isurname/<b>release</b>
</pre>


`isurname`  is the name of the surface and must be unique for each surface defined for the current mesh object.


**release** will release the previously defined surface referenced by name.  All references will be removed from the geometry data structures and all constraints (icr) values associated with this surface will be removed.



### Options for `ibtype`

These options define the boundary type and constraints. 



**`free`** unconstrained, exterior

**`reflect`** constrained, exterior, assigned constraint values (icr).

**`intrface`** unconstrained, interior, will generate parent/child node chains (isn).

**`intrcons`**  constrained, internal, are assigned constraint values (icr) and will generate parent/child node chains (isn). 

**`virtual`** constrained, internal surfaces which have different materials on either side of the virtual interfaces do not
separate material regions but are intended to identify other structural features of a geometry. Nodes on this surface will be assigned constraint values (icr).


### Options for `istype`


*`istype`* are types of surfaces represented by geometric shapes. Each type has parameters specific to its geometry. 



**`box`** / `xmin,ymin,zmin` / `xmax,ymax,zmax` is a cube defined by min and max coordinates, i.e bottom left and top right corners.


**`cylinder`** / `x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/radius` is a cylinder defined by point 1 bottom center and point 2  top center. The radius is the length from center to cylinder edge. Cylinders are open but finite.  To create a closed cylinder cap both ends with planes.



**`cone`** / `x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/radius` is a cone where point 1 is the vertex and point 2 is the base center of the cone with radius from that point. A cone is finite but does have an open end. To create a closed cone cap the open end with a plane.



**`ellipse`** / `x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2 / x3,y3,z3 / ar,br,cr` is an ellipse point 1 is the center of the ellipsoid and point 2 is on the a semi-axis (new x), point 3 is on the b semi-axis (new y). The values ar, br, cr are radii on their respective semi-axes.



**parallel** /  `x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2 / x3,y3,z3 / x4,y4,z4` is a parallel piped where points 1, 2, 3 are the front left, front right and back left points of the base and point 4 is the upper left point of the front face.


**`plane`** or **`planexyz`** / `x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2 / x3,y3,z3` is a plane defined by 3 coordinate points. The direction normal to the plane is determined by the order of the points according to the right hand rule.  


**`planertz`** / `radius1, theta1, z1, radius2, theta2, z2, radius ,zcen` is a plane defined by cylindrical coordinate system.


**`planertp`** / `radius1,theta1,phi1, radius2,theta2,phi2, radius3,theta3,phi3/ xc, yc, zc` is a plane defined by spherical coordinate system.


**`sphere`** / `xc, yc, zc, radius` is a sphere defined by the center point and the radius distance from center point to sphere surface.


**`sheet`** / `cmo_name` is a surface defined by a mesh object  that is a 2D quad or triangle connected mesh. See [inside/outside](#insideoutside) conventions below for a description of inside/outside or left/right with respect to sheet surfaces.


**`tabular`** / `x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2`/ **rz** or **rt** / is a rotated tabular profile where point 1 and point 2 define the axis of rotation for the tabular profile with point 1 as the origin. This is followed by pairs of profile descriptors depending on the value of rz or rt. If **rz**, then the r value is a radius normal to the axis of rotation and z is the distance along the new axis of rotation. If set to **rt** then theta is the angle from the axis of rotation at point 1 and r is the distance from point 1 along theta. The first pair must start on a new line and all lines must contain pairs of data. The last pair of data must be followed by **end**.

## Sheet surfaces inside/outside Convention <a name="insideoutside"></a> 


Inside/outside  will be determined by the following algorithm:

* For the point being considered, p, find the nearest sheet triangle
and the closest point, q, to p that lies on that triangle.

* Construct the vector <img  width="`20" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif">, from q to p.

* Construct the outward normal to the triangle, <img width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">

The outward normal is constructed using the right hand rule and the order of the
points in the sheet. Sheets may be specified as quad Mesh Object (i.e. a
2 dimensional array of points containing the coordinates of the corners
of each quad). Either two triangles (divide each quad in two using point
(i,j) and (i+1,j+1)) or four triangles (add a point in the center of the
quad) are generated by each quad. Applying the right hand rule to the
points (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) gives the direction of the normal for
all triangles created from the quad.

* If <img  width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img  width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  &lt; 0 then
the point is inside. IfÂ  <img  width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img  width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  &gt;0 the
point is outside. If <img  width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  * n = 0, and if
p is on the triangle then p=q and p in on the triangle.

* If <img width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img  width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  = 0 and p is not on the triangle then p is outside.

<img src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image257.gif"> 

One implication of this definition is that the concept of shadows cast
by open sheets no longer is valid. Sheets may be considered to extend to
the boundary of the geometry.
