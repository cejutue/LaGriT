# BOUNDARY_COMPONENTS

----------------------------


Calculate the number of connected components of a mesh. This is
useful for looking for holes in a mesh or as a diagnostic when
looking at a single material (**itetclr**, **imt**) and determining if the
material is contiguous or broken into multiple pieces.


## SYNTAX

<pre>
<b>boundary_components</b> 
<b>boundary_components</b> / <b>node</b> / [<b>reset</b> <b>noreset</b>]
<b>boundary_components</b> / <b>node</b> / material_id_number / [<u><b>reset</b></u> <b>noreset</b>]

<b>boundary_components</b> / <b>element</b> / [<b>reset</b> <u><b>noreset</b></u>]
<b>boundary_components</b> / <b>element</b> / material_id_number / [<b>reset</b> <u><b>noreset</b></u>]
</pre>


**`node`** adds  node attribute **numbnd** and **id_numb** to which is written a  representative node of each outside boundary component.

**`node/connected`** means that a set of nodes of type 'outside' (itp = 10 or
12) can be traversed via element edges that have both vertices of type 'outside'. This method is not really fool proof in detecting holes in a mesh since one can traverse from the exterior of a mesh to an interior hole in the mesh via an edge that is not really a boundary edge. More coding could deal with this situation.

In addition, the number of connected boundary components and a representative node number from each boundary component is assigned
to the **numbnd** array. The number of nodes in each boundary set is printed. Non-boundary nodes are assigned `numbnd = 0`. If the itp
array is not current, it must be updated first, with the command
**`resetpts/itp`**.


By default, **resetpts/itp** is called when the node option is invoked so the **reset**/**noreset** is optional. The node array **id_numb** is similar to **numbnd** in that nodes associate with the same boundary component have the same integer value, however **id_numb** is assigned values starting with 1 and going up to the number of boundary components in sequential order.

**`node`** / `material_id_number` means the distinction of boundary nodes as defined by itp array value is 
ignored. Instead, all nodes with **imt** = `material_id_number` are examined and the number of edge connected components is determined
for just that material. Nodes with imt `material_id_number` are assigned **numbnd = 0**.


`element` adds element attribute **numbnd_e** with the element number of a representative element of a connected set.

The number of connected components of the mesh is computed where 'connected' means sets of elements can be traversed via the element faces. The attribute **numbnd_e** is filled with the element number of a representitive element of a connected set. In addition, the number of connected components and a representative element number from each connected component and the number of elements in each connected component set is printed. 

When the `material_id_number` option is invoked, only elements with **tetclr** = `material_id_number`
are examined. Elements with itetclr `material_id_number` are assigned **numbnd_e = 0**.

Boundary components **node**

Note that the interior nodes have numbnd=0 and the nodes of the upper hole have the same value as the outside boundary since the upper hole can be reached by traversing an edge that is connected to the exterior.

Boundary components **element**

Note that the two pieces are have different values for `numbnd_e` even though element 15 is touching element 6. This is because one cannot traverse from the blue mesh (`numbnd_e = 15`) to the red mesh (`numbnd_e = 24`) through faces of the mesh.
