# RZS

This command is deprecrated, see [CREATEPTS](createpts.md).


Builds a sphere by generating coordinates of points and also modifies zoning by ratio-zoning point distributions. See the **rz** command for
more details. The itype flag defines what type of sphere will be generated.


Use **`connect`** to generate tet or triangle connectivity from the point distribution.

### Types for sphere `itype`:



*   **`1`** generates a sphere by gridding the faces of a cube and then projecting the vertices onto a sphere. The number of nodes per shell is of the form `6*i**2`. 

*   **`2`** generates a sphere by subdividing an icosahedron placed on the surface of a sphere. Icosahedral gridding is made up of 10 diamonds per shell. Each diamond is made up of `n**2` nodes (where n must be of the form `2**i+1`). There are 2 nodes (the poles of the sphere) at which 5 diamonds meet and 10 nodes where 3 diamonds meet; hence there are a minimum of 12 nodes per shell. The number of nodes per shell can be 12, 42, 162, 642,...etc. 


*   **`8`** generates a hexahedral icosahedron grid. This option distributes points and generates the grid connectivity data structures. This option does not require a connect command.


*  **`diamond`** generates the points for one diamond of the icosahedron.



### Options:

*`nr`* is the number of radial shells

*`npt`* is the upper limit of the number of points in a shell, the number of points generated will be less than or equal to this number.


*`xirad`* , *`xorad`* are the inner and outer radii of the sphere. For `itype` =8 reverse inner and outer radii.

*`xcen`*, *`ycen`*, *`zcen`* are the coordinates of the center of the sphere

*`iz`*Â  if =0 then mins and maxs are used as cell centers, if =1 then mins and maxs are used as cell vertices

*`irat`* is ratio zoning switch (0=off,1=on)

*`rz`* is ratio zoning value - distance is multiplied by the value for each subsequent point.
