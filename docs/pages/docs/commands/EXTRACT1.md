# EXTRACT

--------------

  This command produces a 2D mesh object from a 3D mesh object. A
  material interface, a plane , an isosurface or a network may be
  extracted. 
 
The output mesh object will be oriented such that the outward normal of the
  plane that defines the surface will point in the same direction as
  the normals for the triangles in the output MO. If the command
  extracts on an isosurface, the output MO will be oriented such that
  the normals for the triangles point in the direction of increasing
  field. If the command extracts on an interface, the output MO
  triangles will be oriented the same as the triangles extracted from
  region1 of the input MO. In the case of a plane extracted along all
  or a portion of a material interface, only those points that lie
  inside the material (i.e.: away from the direction of the normal)
  will be picked up. If the extraction is on a boundary, the normal to
  the extraction plane must point out of the material in order for
  points to be picked up.

The following options are available:

- **`plane/threepts/`** plane may be defined by three points in the plane  `x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/x3,y3,z3`

- **`plane/ptnorm`**/ plane defined by vector normal to the plane `x1,y1,z1` and `xn,yn,zn`

- **`plane/axes`**/  three points on the axes of the space `xv,yv,zv`

- **`plane/abcd`**/ `a,b,c,d` are the coefficients of the plane equation ax+by+cz=d

- **`isosurf`**/ An isosurface is defined by the value of the surface and the `attribute` to test for this `value`.

- **`intrface`**/ An interface is defined by the material(s) bounding the interface `region1`

- **`intrfac2`**/ `region1` [`region2`] are the material numbers or the material region (mregion) names whose interface is to be extracted. Use `-all-` to extract from all interfaces. 

- **`network`** A network is defined as the material interface network from the mesh object. Unlike the other extract forms, this extracts the "parent" interface and not the "child" interface, and ignores boundaries. The output cmo also contains a new attribute "map" which maps nodes in the output cmo to (parent) nodes in the input cmo. This is supposed to work for 2D meshes (tri, quad, or hybrid) in 2D or 3D and 3D meshes (tet, pyr, pri, hex or hybrid).

- **`surfmesh`** extracts the boundary and interface surfaces of a mesh. The keyword `external` will not extract interior interfaces. See full description at [**`extract/surfmesh`**](dump/EXTRACT_SURFMESH.md).

`cmoout` and `cmoin` are the new output mesh object name and source input mesh object name.

`1,0,0` is the range ifirst, ilast, istride selection to work on.
