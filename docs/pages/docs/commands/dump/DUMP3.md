# DUMP/ fehm
# DUMP/ stor

Output a set of files that are of general use but are specifically
designed for the [FEHM](http://fehm.lanl.gov) porous flow and transport
code. Both commands **dump/fehm** and **dump/stor** use the same set of optional settings after the required file root name and cmo name.

The keyword **fehm** writes the full set of 7 FEHM files.

The keyword **stor** writes a single FEHM sparse matrix stor file.

## OUTPUT FILES:

The *root* will be used to form full names for the files that are written:
```
rootname.fehmn              rootname_interface.zone      rootname_outside_vor.area     
rootname_material.zone      rootname_multi_mat.zone      rootname_outside.zone       rootname.stor
```


1.  **.fehmn** is a list of
    mesh object node x,y,z values and the element connectivity list in ASCII FEHM format (also dump/coord/... command).
2.  **\_material.zone**
    is a file with a node list for each integer material (imt) value (also dump/zone/imt/... command).
3.  **\_interface.zone**
    is output of FEHM zone format files of nodes along an interface
    where interface is defined as a node to node connection where the
    integer attribute imt changes. *Note this file will have 0 length if
    there is only one material.*
4.  **\_multi_mat.zone**
    is a list of multi-material connections,
    where multi-material is defined as a node to node connection where
    the integer attribute imt changes. Each list consists of a header
    followed by the list of node pairs. The header consists of the
    material number followed by "multi-material connections" on the same
    line, followed by "nnum" (nedges) on the next line, followed by the
    number of entries in the list. The list of node pairs are written
    where first node is inside the current material and the second is
    the connected node on other side of material interface. The lists
    are sorted by the first node. *Note this file will have 0 length if
    there is only one material.*
5.  **\_outside.zone**
    is a list of each node located on the outside areas. 

    If the keyword **keepatt** is included, then 6 node based attributes are added to
    the mesh object with the names top, bottom, left\_w, right\_e,
    back\_n, and front\_s. Note that a node can belong to more than 1
    zone list. For example, in an orthogonal cube aligned with the
    coordinate axes, a corner node can belong to 3 zone lists (e.g.
    front\_s, top and left\_w lists). By default, these node
    attributes are deleted after the zone file is written and the mesh
    object remains unchanged. (also dump/zone\_outside/... command).
    
    These outside zones are defined as 6 possible external boundaries for
    rectangular geometries and are defined as:

```
    1 = top = top = positive z direction (0,0,1)

    2 = bottom = bottom = negative z direction (0,0,-1)

    3 = left\_w = left or west = negative x direction (-1,0,0)

    4 = front\_s = front or south = negative y direction (0,-1,0)

    5 = right\_e = right or east = positive x direction (1,0,0)

    6 = back\_n = back or north = positive y direction (0,1,0)

 ```
 
6.  **\_outside_vor.area** (default) or **\_outside_med.area**
    uses outside nodes to write a list of
    2D area or 1D length vectors (Ax\_i,Ay\_i,Az\_i) associated with
    each and listed the same order as zones and nodes in the file root_name_outside.zone.

    optional keyword **keepatt\_voronoi** will keep the attributes created for outside voronoi areas.
    Three node attributes (xn\_varea, yn\_varea, zn\_varea)
    are added and they contain the vector area associated with the
    voronoi areas for each of the nodes located on their external
    triangles.

    optional keyword **keepatt\_median** will keep the attributes created for outside median areas.
    Three node attributes (xn\_marea, yn\_marea, zn\_marea)
    are added and they contain the vector area associated with the
    median area for each of the nodes located on their external
    triangles. These area vectors are computed by computing the median
    mesh (triangle centroids connected to triangle edge centers)  If the
    input mesh are 2D triangles, the median length of external edges
    incident upon a node are written. 
7.  **.stor**
    is geometric coefficient matrix written in FEHM stor file format.
    These are the Voronoi (control volume) area and volume associated
    with each node and the sparse matrix structure. 
    ASCII compressed is the default file output.

    The **stor** file represents a sparse coefficient matrix and is used for
    solving PDE on a triangular or tetrahedral Delaunay mesh. The stor
    format is written for FEHM input and is described at this page:   
    [FEHM STOR File Format](../../STOR_Form.md)



## FORMAT:

### Simple:

 **dump** / **fehm** / root\_name / cmo\_name
 
 **dump** / **stor** / root\_name / cmo\_name

 
 The root\_name will be used to form names for all files written.

 **dump/fehm** will write full set of FEHM input files including a stor file

 **dump/stor** will write a sparse matrix stor file only (default is ASCII compressed scalar)

 
### Optional Keywords:

The following command settings are optional and can occur in any order after the cmo\_name.

 

**ascii** or **binary**  indicate IO Mode Options for the stor file. Default is ascii.


**scalar**,  **vector**,  **both**,  **area\_scalar**,  **area\_vector**, or **area\_both** are Area Coefficient Options for writing stor file coefficient values. Default is scalar.
 

**all**,  **graph**,  **coefs**, or  **none** are Compression Options for the stor file. Default is all.


**delatt** or  **keepatt**  deletes or keeps CMO Attributes created to find outside zone nodes. Default is delatt.


**hybrid** or **nohybrid** Specify whether hybrid median-Voronoi control volumes should be used. Default is nohybrid.
 


#### STOR IO MODES:

   
   **binary**             Output sparse matrix stor file in Fortran unformatted format *Note: These files are platform dependent.* 

   **ascii** (default)    Output sparse matrix stor file as ASCII format. This is a larger file but not machine dependent.


#### STOR Area Coefficient OPTIONS:


   **scalar** (default)    Area/distance               coefficients are output as scalars 
   
   
   **vector**              Area/distance               coefficients are output as vectors 
   
   
   **both**                Area/distance               coefficients are output as scalars and vectors 
   
   
   **area\_scalar**        Area                        coefficients are output as scalars
   
   
   **area\_vector**        Area                        coefficients are output as vectors 
   
   
   **area\_both **         Area                        coefficients are output as scalars and vectors 

 


#### STOR Compression OPTIONS:


**all** (default)   (\_astor) compression of area coefficients and compression of coefficient indices
 

**graph**           (\_gstor) compression of area coefficient indices (edge compression)  



**coefs**           (\_cstor) compression of area coefficient to a list of unique values. *Note: This older algorithm uses more space and time.*


**none**            (\_nstor) full indices and area coefficient list. *Note: This older algorithm uses more space and time.*


The attributes ccoef and ij\_ccoef may be added if negative area coefficients are detected when the \_astor or \_gstor compression algorithms are invoked (default) or by using the **all** or **graph** keywords, these two new attributes are added to the CMO. Since the area coefficients are really edge based quantities but we only have access to node and element quantities, the following convention is used.


If any area coefficient is negative the integer node array ij\_ccoef and real node array ccoef are created. All connections with area coefficients >= 0 are set to zero in these attributes, so values will range from the largest negative value to 0. This is not implemented for 2D and there is no option to turn this feature on or off.

If no area coefficients are negative the arrays are not created.

If the area coefficient A\_ij, between nodes i and j is negative then
```
ccoef(i)    = ccoef(j) = A\_ij
ij\_ccoef(i) = j
ij\_ccoef(j) = i
```
                                                     
 *Note: The old syntax using the alternate\_scalar keyword is now the
 default option using scalar and compressed. It is the same as using keywords
 all or graph and if used will be recognized.*


#### CMO Attributes for outside zones:

 
**delatt** (default)  No new cmo attributes are created.

   
**keepatt** Six node attributes are created (top, bottom, left\_w, right\_e,back\_n, front\_s) which are assigned values according to the direction of the octant of their normal vector. Each outside node can occur in multiple directions. For instance an edge between top and left side will be in both top and left\_w attributes. Attribute values greater than 0 are nodes found in that direction.

   

#### STOR Hybrid OPTIONS:

   
**nohybrid** (default)   Do not use hybrid median-Voronoi control volumes


**hybrid**               Use hybrid median-Voronoi control volumes.
 

 These hybrid volumes represent a means for addressing poorly shaped
 tetrahedra on a boundary of the mesh. Boundary tetrahedra whose
 Voronoi centers are outside the mesh lead to incorrect modeling
 results. Alternatively, if we construct control volumes using medians
 (centroids), the center point for each element always lies within that
 element, but median meshes lack other nice properties of Voronoi
 meshes.    

 As a compromise between the median and Voronoi approaches, we start
 with a Voronoi mesh and fix boundary tetrahedra whose circumcenters
 are not contained within the boundary of the mesh. To fix such an
 element, we draw a line segment from the median center to the Voronoi
 center and find the point at which this segment intersects the surface
 of the element. This intersection then becomes the center point for
 the purposes of determining control volumes. Essentially we move the
 Voronoi center toward the median point until it just reaches the
 element.   

 When we use the hybrid approach, we also make a slight change to the
 way we calculate the area coefficients. Voronoi control volumes have
 the property that their faces are always perpendicular to the mesh
 edges that intersect them. With hybrid control volumes (as well as
 median control volumes), this is not the case. To compensate for this,
 when we compute the area coefficient we only consider the component of
 the face area vector which is in the same direction as the edge. We
 accomplish this by taking the area vector and dotting it with a unit
 vector in the direction of the edge.    

 The **hybrid** option may lead to poor results if it is applied to a
 mesh that is non-Delaunay, because there may be elements which it
 cannot fix, such as interior elements whose circumcenters are outside
 the mesh. A warning will be printed if the code detects that the mesh
 appears to be non-Delaunay.    

 *NOTE: The hybrid option is only available with the default implmentation using no other options or including **all**, **graph**, and **scalar** in the command.*
