>> The MODE Command&nbsp_place_holder; sets up several optimization options

Currently implemented are:

(1) discrete optimization:

**mode/discrete**/surface_cmo/tolldamage
>>

>>> if this mode is set, **refine,** **smooth**, **merge** will require any
operation that involves nodes on the specified surface to result in a mesh
whose surface nodes are also members of the surface_cmo.

A mesh object attribute associated with the 3d mesh named discrete_optimize
will be created and its value will be the name of the surface mesh object.

>>

>> (2) error_adaption

**mode**/**adaption_field**/field_name
>>

>>> if this mode is set, optimization operations will be based on reducing
error.&nbsp_place_holder; A mesh object attribute associated with the 3d mesh
named 'adaption_field' will be created and it's value will be the name of the
field.

>>

>> (3) reconnection

**mode/recon**/**geom**   
**mode/recon**/**delaunay**   
**mode/recon**/**adaption**
>>

>>> Setting this mode will determine the criterion used to
[reconnect](RECON.html) the mesh.&nbsp_place_holder; The default mode is
**delaunay** and setting mode to **delaunay** will cause recon to attempt to
create a [delaunay mesh](CONNECT1.html).&nbsp_place_holder; Setting mode to
**geom** will reconnect to increase inscribed radii of
elements.&nbsp_place_holder; Setting mode to adaption will reconnect to reduce
solution error.&nbsp_place_holder; Field_name must be set with the
**mode**/**adaption_field **command.
