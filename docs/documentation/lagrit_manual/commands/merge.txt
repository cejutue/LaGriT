>> Merge pairs of points together. On return, the first_point of a pair is the
survivor unless first_point may not be removed ( a corner point for example),
then the command operates as if first_point and second_point have been
interchanged. If there is no confirmation of the merge, one or both of the
points may be inactive, or the merge may be illegal because the points are not
neighbors or because this merge is disallowed by the merge tables. Merging may
trigger other merges by the reconnection step that follows the merge.

The command [massage](MASSAGE.html) may be used to merge nodes together based
on the edge distance separating the nodes.
