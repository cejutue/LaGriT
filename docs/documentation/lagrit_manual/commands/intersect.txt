>

>> Creates a new Mesh Object from the intersection of two existing Mesh
Objects. The existing Mesh Objects have to be topologically 2D and
geometrically 3D. The created Mesh Object will be topologically 1D and
geometrically 3D. Node quantities for the new Mesh Object will be created by
interpolation on the corresponding node quantities of the first input Mesh
Object, cmo_1_in.

>

>> This command will also apply the **line_graph** option of the **sort**
command on the new Mesh Object. This will sort the elements (which will be
line segments) into a reasonable order based on their connectivity, and will
also create element attributes ctype, cid, and loop_id. **intersect** will
create a temporary sort key and use that to reorder the elements, so there is
no need to use your own sort key. For more details on the sorting and on the
created element attributes, please see [sort](SORT.html).
