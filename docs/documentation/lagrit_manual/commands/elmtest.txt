>> This command test a mesh for valid jtet connectivity.&nbsp_place_holder; If
the mesh is a network it allows for jtet loops; in this case the jtet
relationship is not reflexive but, for example if the loop has length 3.

>> Normally degenerate faces may not have neighbors with a different number of
nodes; however, if&nbsp_place_holder; a scalar mesh attribute
'jtet_reduce_nnd' is defined and has the value 1, faces will match if the node
numbers are the same even if a node number appears more that once.
