Most gocad examples have been moved to level01

This example file is not included in level01 tests.
It is a 3D tet file with Z elevation normal (not depth).
The routine reports neg volumes for this mesh file.

The mesh file may be at fault, it was derived from a JewelSuite export with depth.
This example should be replaced and tested with a known good mesh file.
