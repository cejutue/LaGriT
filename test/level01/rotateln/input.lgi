# Test the rotateln command. This test was written in the process of tracking
# down a bug where part of the point distribution would rotate in one direction
# and the other part would rotate in the opposite direction. This test should
# work now although it did not work before this bug was fixed.

# Create a cube of points and rotate it 90 degrees about the z-axis.
