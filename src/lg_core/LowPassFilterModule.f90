!!  LowPassFilterModule -- A Fortran 90 module for low-pass filtering of
!!      discrete graph signals.
!!
!!  This module provides the core procedures that implement the low-pass
!!  filtering of discrete graph signals described in [1,2].  By generalizing
!!  classical discrete fourier analysis to discrete graph signals --
!!  functions defined on the nodes of an undirected graph -- the problem
!!  of smoothing is reduced to that of low-pass filtering.
!!
!!  Classical Fourier analysis decomposes a signal into the eigencomponents
!!  of the Laplacian, so to extend Fourier analysis to discrete graph signals,
!!  one merely needs to define a generalized laplacian on the graph.  The
!!  simplest definition, and the one used here, is to define the "laplacian"
!!  at a node to be the difference between the signal at that node and the
!!  mean of the signals at the neighboring nodes.
!!
!!  In the context of surface and mesh smoothing, the relevent discrete graph
!!  signal is the node coordinates on the graph associated with the simplicial
!!  mesh.  In this instance, we may desire that the filtering preserve
!!  certain intrinsic topological features of mesh as well as some extrinsic
!!  "geometric" features.  This is easily accomplished by modifying the
!!  neighbor structure of the graph (see CreateLaplacian below).

!!
!!  PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!!    A integer parameter, r8, is provided that gives the kind value of all
!!        reals used in the module.  Typically this should correspond to
!!        8-byte reals.
!!
!!    An ADT, ASetType, is provided to facilitate the construction of the
!!        Laplacian (see CreateLaplacian below).  It has a single component
!!        which is a pointer to a rank-1 integer array.
!!
!!    call HammingFilterCoef (f, n, k_pb [,sigma]) returns the polynomial
!!        coefficients of the Nth degree Hamming filter.  The coefficients
!!        are normalized to sum to 1, which make them, strictly speaking,
!!        not the true Hamming coefficients.  F is an intent(out), rank-1,
!!        real array containing the filter coefficients.  Its length must be
!!        at least N+1.  K_PB is a real intent(in) variable that specifies
!!        the pass-band value, and should lie within the interval (0,2).
!!        The Hamming filter can be regarded as the convolution of the ideal
!!        low-pass filter with a mollification kernel that is a trig series
!!        defined by the filter coefficients.  If the real, intent(in)
!!        variable SIGMA is not present, the pass-band is shifted right by
!!        an amount equal to the radius of this mollification kernel.  This
!!        assures that the filter will be approximately 1 in the entire
!!        interval (0, K_PB).  If SIGMA is present, its value is used as the
!!        shift amount.
!!
!!    PolynomialFilter (x, f) returns the filtered "signal".  F is a rank-1,
!!        real, intent(in) array that contains the coefficients of a polynomial
!!        filter, such as is returned by HammingFilterCoef.  X is a rank-2,
!!        real, intent(in) array that contains the input "signal"; X(:,j) is
!!        the signal at node j.
!!
!!    GaussianFilter (x, lambda) returns the Gaussian filtered "signal".
!!        LAMBDA is a real, intent(in) variable, and X is a rank-2, real,
!!        intent(in) array that contains the input "signal".  The filtered
!!        signal is simply  X - LAMBDA * Laplacian(X).
!!
!!    call CreateLaplacian (mask, xset, aset, cvtx [,cnbr, cmat]) constructs
!!        the Laplacian that is central to the filtering algorithm.
!!
!!        Unless otherwise noted, all arguments are intent(in).
!!
!!        MASK is a rank-1, integer array.  Node j is ignored if MASK(j) == 0.
!!
!!        CVTX is a rank-2 integer array giving the vertices of the
!!            simplicial cells which form the mesh.  CVTX(:,j) are the
!!            vertices of cell j.
!!
!!        CNBR is a rank-2 integer array giving the neighbors of the cells.
!!            CNBR(:,j) are the neighbors of cell j encoded in the following
!!            manner.  If cells j and j' are adjacent, with face k of cell j
!!            and face k' of cell j' being the shared face then
!!            CNBR(k,j) = k' + n * (j'-1) and CNBR(k',j') = k + n * (j-1)
!!            where n is the number of vertices of the simplicial cell.
!!            If CNBR(k,j) = 0 then this face is a boundary face, and if
!!            CNBR(k,j) < 0 then this is a material interface face, with
!!            |CNBR(k,j)| giving the neighbor encoded as above.
!!
!!        CMAT is a rank-1, integer array giving the material numbers for
!!            the cells.  If adjacent cells have different material numbers
!!            then their shared face should be indicated as a material
!!            interface face in CNBR, and conversely.
!!
!!        The graph that defines the laplacian is derived from the simplicial
!!        mesh described by CVTX, CNBR, and CMAT.  There are two possible
!!        cases.  If CNBR and CMAT are present, then the mesh is a multi-
!!        material mesh and there is a distinguished hierarchy of topological
!!        features.  For a 3D mesh, there are the 3D material volumes, the
!!        2D material interface network, the 1D network of interface
!!        boundaries/singularities, and the isolated point set of singularity
!!        points of the 1D network.  The neighbors of a node in one class are
!!        restricted to those in the same or subsequent classes.  By
!!        modifying the graph in this way, the resulting filtering will respect
!!        these topological features; a material interface, for example, is
!!        smoothed as a unit without regard to connected volume nodes.  For
!!        a 2D mesh the situation is similar.
!!
!!        If CNBR and CMAT are absent, then the mesh is complex of simplicial
!!        cells described completely by CVTX.  It may be a simple 2D surface,
!!        for example, or a 2D surface network such as the material interface
!!        network of a multi-material 3D mesh.  In any case, there is also
!!        a (shorter) hierarchy of topological features, and the graph
!!        associated with the mesh is modified as above.
!!
!!        The remaining arguments describe the extrinsic "geometric" features
!!        of the mesh that the filtering should respect.  This is modeled in
!!        the following way.  Associated with each node is an integer set of
!!        "attributes" (possibly empty).  The neighbors of one node are
!!        restricted to those nodes whose attribute sets contain the attribute
!!        set of the first.
!!
!!        XSET is a rank-1 integer array giving the attribute set index for
!!            each node.  If XSET(j) == 0 the the attribute set for node j
!!            is empty.
!!
!!        ASET is a rank-1 array of ASetType values.  ASET(j) is the jth
!!            attribute set.
!!
!!    call DeleteLaplacian () deallocates all storage associated with the
!!        Laplacian.
