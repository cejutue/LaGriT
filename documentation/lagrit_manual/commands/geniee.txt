>> OPTION1:

Generate element connectivity list (jtet) that gives neighbor information.
Element connectivity is maintained by LaGriT, but can also be generated by the
user with this command.

>>

>> The jtet attribute contains for each facet of an element the neighboring
element and its local face.&nbsp_place_holder; For 3D grids the jtet
relationship is reflexsive; each element-face pair has exactly one neighboring
element-face pair.&nbsp_place_holder; For 2D grids the jtet relationship can
include cycles; a triangle or quad edge may have many edge
neighbors.&nbsp_place_holder; In this case the jtet is constructed as a closed
cycle where the jtet of one element-edge pair will be a neighboring element-
edge pair whose jtet wil be another neighboring element-edge pair and so on
until all neighbors are included in the cycle exactly once.

>>

>> The jtet is constructed by looking at matching node numbers and will use
the parent nodes if they exist.&nbsp_place_holder; Faces with matching node
coordinates but different node numbers will not be matched.

For hybrid grids that contain degenerate elements there are two
options.&nbsp_place_holder; If the mesh object attribute jtet_reduce_nnd
exists and is set to 1, then faces with repeated node numbers will be matched
to faces with the same numbers but not repeated.&nbsp_place_holder; For
example if a degenerate hex has a face 1 1 2 3 and there is an element (prism,
tet, pyramid) with face 1 2 3 and if jtet_reduce_nnd is 1, then these faces
will be matched.&nbsp_place_holder; Otherwise they will be marked as external
boundary faces.

>>

>> OPTION2:

Attempt to make the topological orientation (itet array) of a triangle, quad,
or hybrid tri/quad mesh consistent so that shared edges are traversed in
opposite directions. This is only possible in a mesh with jtet_loop_max = 2.
For networks with jtet_loop_max > 2 there may not be a configuration that
meets the goal.

>>

>> This command could also be used to flip the normals of a mesh that is
already consistent. For example:

geniee / -def- / 2dnormal / -1

>>

>> _Note:_ For the case where a mesh is not completely edge connected, this
module will detect that all elements have not been tested and will warn the
user and suggest a command line syntax to test elements not visited.

  
_Note:_ Code not set up for a mesh with parent/child chains. When check is
made, it compares child points. When permutation of elements is done, only
itet and jtet arrays are updated.

OPTION 2:

**geniee** / **cmoname** / **2dnormal** / **reference_element_number** / [addatt]  
**cmoname** - name of mesh object to operate on. Can be /&nbsp_place_holder; / or /-def-/  
**2dnormal** - keyword to cause this module to execute  
**reference_element_number** - default = 1  
  
This is the element number that will be the reference element that all other
elements are compared to. If this parameter is a negative number, the
orientation of element number abs(reference_element_number) is reversed and
then used as the reference.

  
**reference_element_number** = 0 will check and report if orientation is consistent, but will not do any flipping.  
  
**addatt** - if the keyword addatt is included, two new arrays are added to the mesh object.   
**ipath** - The order in which elements are visited.

> EXAMPLE:

>

>> geniee / cmo / 2dnormal

  
Check orientation of tri/quad elements and if their orientation is different
than element 1, then flip their orientation.

  
geniee / cmo/2dnormal/-1

  
Flip the orientation of element one and then make the rest of the mesh
consistent with element 1. If the mesh object is already consistent, then this
command will reverse the orientation of all the elements in a surface (tri,
quad) mesh.

  
geniee / -def- / 2dnormal / 17

  
Check orientation of tri/quad elements and if their orientation is different
than element 17, then flip their orientation.

  
geniee / cmo / 2dnormal / 0

  
Check orientation of tri/quad elements and if their orientation is different
than element 1, report the difference but do not change the mesh object
orientation.

  
geniee / cmo / 2dnormal / 0 / addatt

  
Check orientation of tri/quad elements and if their orientation is different
than element 1, report the difference but do not change the mesh object
orientation. Create two new attributes. ipath is the search path the algorithm
followed through the mesh. ifflip reports the orientation of each element as
compared to element 1.
