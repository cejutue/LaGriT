> **_PERTURB_**

This command moves node coordinates in the following manner.

Three pairs random numbers between 0 and 1 are obtained. These pairs refer to
the x, y and z coordinates of the nodes respectively. The first random number
of each pair is multiplied by the factor given in thecommand. The second
random number is used to determine if the calculated offset is to be added or
subtracted from the coordinate. No checking is done to see if elements are
inverted by this perturbation.&nbsp_place_holder; It is assumed that the mesh
is not yet connected.

&nbsp_place_holder; EXAMPLES
**perturb/**1,0,0/0.5,0,0&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; add offsets to
only the xcoordinates of all nodes

**perturb/pset,get,mypset**/0.001,0.001,0.001&nbsp_place_holder; add small offsets to all coordinates of the nodes in the **pset** named **mypset.**
